## Plotting a curve

The shortest example, the function $y = x^2$ is evaluated with values inside the range
defined by the canvas size (the default dimensions are `550x350`)

The required parameters are:

- `target` a selector to the node to hold the graph
- `data` an array of objects which contain info about the functions to render
 - `data.fn` (string) a mathematical expression to render, it's parsed and evaluated
 using [interval-arithmetic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/interval-arithmetic-eval)

The syntax of the string that represent the mathematical expression is just like ECMAScript
however the `^` operator has been replaced with `pow` and there's no namespace for the
functions to be evaluated

export const helloWorld = `
functionPlot({
  target: '#hello',
  data: [{ fn: 'x^2' }]
})
`

<Render id="hello" content={helloWorld}></Render>
