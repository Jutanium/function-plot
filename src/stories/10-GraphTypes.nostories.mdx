## Types of graph

There are three ways to represent a function in `function-plot`

- `polyline` where $f(x)$ is evaluated with some $x$ values, after the evaluation the points are joined with line segments using
   `<path>`s
- `scatter` where $f(x)$ is evaluated with some $x$ values, after the evaluation the points are represented by `<circle>`s
- `interval` where $f(x)$ is evaluated with intervals instead of a single point, after the evaluation 2d rects
  are painted on the screen (done using the `<path>` svg element)

Set the type of graph you want to render in the option `graphType` (defaults to `interval`)

export const script = `
functionPlot({
  target: '#graph-types',
  data: [{
    fn: '-sqrt(-x)',
    nSamples: 100,
    graphType: 'scatter'
  }, {
    fn: 'sqrt(x)',
    graphType: 'polyline'
  }, {
    fn: 'x^2',
    graphType: 'interval'
  }]
})
`
